Structure
----
First it's a good practice to include your name, which assignment and the due date.

A brief description of the program, its main purposes and the tools you used to run this program.

It's best to include all the files you have in the directory and the description of each file.

Then a how to run instructions and how to clean files.

Finally, the expected output of the program if run correctly.


Why ReadMe file ?
----

A README file is very important in every project. It contains the what and how of the project.  It is helfpul in terms of explaining to the reader what is being uploaded, how to use it or install it, basically like your project's manual. 

A README file is part of your project's documentation.. Documentation is knowledge sharing, therefore a README file is sort of a getting started documentation. Always share your creative ideas with other people!!!
